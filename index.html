      Harry Edward Styles (born 1 February 1994) is an English singer,
      songwriter, and actor. His musical career began in 2010, when he
      auditioned for the British singing competition The X Factor. He was
      eliminated early on, but he was brought back to form the boy band One
      Direction. After the band's indefinite hiatus in 2016, Styles signed with
      Columbia Records as a solo artist. In 2017, Styles released his debut solo
      single, "Sign of the Times", which topped the UK Singles Chart and peaked
      at number four on the Billboard Hot 100. It was named "Song of the Year"
      by Rolling Stone, while its music video earned Styles a Brit Award. His
      self-titled debut album was released later in the year, topping the charts
      in fourteen countries and ranking in several music critics' year-end
      lists. Styles made his acting debut in Christopher Nolan's war film
      Dunkirk (2017). His second album, Fine Line (2019), broke a record as the
      biggest sales debut from an English male artist in the US.
